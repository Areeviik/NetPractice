# NetPractice
<pre>
This project is about solving networking problems to make a network run.
There are 10 levels available for training. For each level, a non-functioning network diagram appears.
At the top of your window, you will see a goal to achieve: the issues to solve so that
the network runs properly. There are two buttons you can use:
  • Check again to verify whether your configuration was correct or not.
  • Get my config to download your configuration whenever you need to.
At the bottom of the page, you will see logs. They can be helpful to understand why
your configuration is wrong.
